# search-engine-


## Description
This project is a Book Search Engine built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It allows users to search for books through the Google Books API, save their favorite books to a personal account, and view or delete saved books. The application has been refactored from a RESTful API to a GraphQL API using Apollo Server. It includes features such as user authentication, user-specific saved books, and a responsive user interface.
